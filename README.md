# Quantum Computing Course

This repository shows my progress through IBM's online course "[Introduction to Quantum Computing and Quantum Hardware](https://qiskit.org/learn/intro-qc-qh/)". The course is split into 9 modules, each with a hands-on lab activity to implement what we learned in lecture using Qiskit. I show my solutions to each lab activity.
